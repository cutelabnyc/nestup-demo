                <a href="https://github.com/cutelabnyc/nested-tuplets">Nestup</a> is an experimental markup language for musical rhythms. It's specifically designed to break away from a fixed musical grid
            </p>
            <p>
                The name is a contraction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuplet#Nested_tuplets">nested tuplets</a>, which are hard to program on a piano roll but easy to notate with Nestup.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're new to Nestup, try out a few presets to see what the language can do. The cheat sheet will give you a quick reference for some of the basic language features, and <a href="https://github.com/cutelabnyc/nested-tuplets">our GitHub page</a> has more in-depth documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can read a lot more about Nestup <a href="https://github.com/cutelabnyc/nested-tuplets">on our GitHub page</a>.

                If you like this project and want to support it, consider buying our <a href="brokenlink">Max for Live device</a>, which puts Nestup directly into Ableton Live, along with some other fun features.
